# EDA
EDA helps you:

Understand its characteristics: What are the data types? Are there missing values? What's the distribution of each variable?
Discover patterns and relationships: Are there any trends or correlations between variables? Can you identify subgroups with unique characteristics?
Spot anomalies and outliers: Are there any data points that deviate significantly from the norm? Do they require further investigation or removal?
Formulate hypotheses and questions: Based on your findings, what interesting questions arise? What further analyses are needed?
